 #Expo cli
 
 Expo CLI is a command line app that is the main interface between a developer and Expo tools. You'll use it for a variety of tasks, such as:
Creating new projects
Developing your app: running the project server, viewing logs, opening your app in a simulator
Publishing your app JavaScript and other assets and managing releasing them over the air
Building binaries (apk and ipa files) to be uploaded to the App Store and Play Store
Managing Apple Credentials and Google Keystores
You may use the CLI in your terminal or use the web based interface (it opens automatically by default, or you can press d from the CLI to open it on demand). The web interface enables you to use some of the most often used features from a quick-to-use graphical interface. Weâ€™ve only scratched the surface of what expo-cli can do so far.
