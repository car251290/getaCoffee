 # Making it easier to press the button
 When you are using your finger to tap on a button, you don't want to have to hold for get to next screen and get the map to find the near coffee shop.
 
 ## API map for search for a coffe
 I will use an API of location for adding a map to get the nears coffee shop.

yarn add firebase

 Motivitation is getting better code understandable code.
 To solve this, Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data
 
 ## React Navigation 
 
 npm install @react-navigation/native
React Navigation is made up of some core utilities and those are then used by navigators to create the navigation structure in your app. Don't worry too much about this for now, it'll become clear soon enough! To frontload the installation work, let's also install and configure dependencies used by most navigators, then we can move forward with starting to write some code.
 
 ## Using of Card React Native
 
 If you are using react-native version 0.60 or higher you don't need to link react-native-vector-icons.

If you don't want to install vector icons, you can use babel-plugin-optional-require to opt-out.

If you use Expo, you don't need to install vector icons. But if you have a babel.config.js or .babelrc file, make sure that it includes babel-preset-expo.
